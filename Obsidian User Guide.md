Obsidian and Markdown let you **own your data** — everything’s stored in plain text, readable anywhere, forever.  
They help you **think in connections**, turning simple notes into a living network of ideas and documentation.  
Perfect for developers, creators, and small businesses, it’s the **fastest, most secure way** to build knowledge systems without paying to store your own ideas.
