# README: Basic Text Manipulation Exercises

## Objective

Practice using **Find**, **Replace**, **Copy**, **Paste**, and **Undo/Redo** in any text editor, preferably in a notepad or in a [[sandbox vault]].
These skills form the foundation of working with plain text and preparing structured data later.

---

## Instructions

Use any text editor (Notepad, gedit, Nano, LibreOffice Writer in plain text mode, etc.).
Follow each step carefully and save your progress as `text_exercise_1.txt`.

---

### Exercise 1: Find and Replace

1. Copy the following sentence into your editor:

   ```
   This is a sentence for editing practice.
   ```
2. Replace all lowercase `e` with an exclamation mark `!`.
3. Replace the word `sentence` with `line`.
4. Replace all spaces with underscores `_`.
5. Undo your last change.
6. Save as `lesson1`

---

### Exercise 2: Line Editing

1. Copy these three lines:

   ```
   Bananas are yellow.
   Watermelons are green.
   Grapes are purple.
   Apples are red.
   ```
2. Rearrange them so they appear in **alphabetical order** by fruit name.
3. Delete the line regarding Grapes.
4. Duplicate the last remaining line twice.

### Exercise 3: Copy, Paste, and Format

1. Type this:

   ```
   name,age,city
   John,28,London
   Sarah,33,London
   Jess,19,Perth
   Bob,53,London
   Juanito,12,Madrid
   ```
2. Copy the last line (`Sarah,33,Manchester`) and paste it above the header.
3. Using find and replace, and make all `London` entries say `londres` (That's Spanish for London!)
4. Change the city name in each entry so no two are the same.
5. Save this as `people_data.txt`.

---

### Exercise 4: Cleanup

1. Open a new file and paste this text:

   ```
   The quick brown fox     jumps over the lazy dog.
   ```
2. Remove extra spaces between the words.
3. Replace the word “dog” with “cat”.
4. Save the cleaned version as `cleanup_result.txt`.

---

### Exercise 5: Bonus Challenge

1. Type or paste:

   ```
   data,entry,field
   data,entry,field
   data,entry,field
   ```
2. Use **Find & Replace All** to change `data` → `record`.
3. Use **Replace All** again to change every comma `,` into a tab space.
4. Save as `tabbed_data.txt`.

---

## Completion

Once finished:

* You should have several `.txt` files showing your edits.
* Review them to make sure your changes were saved.
* You’ve just practiced the building blocks for managing configuration files, scripts, and datasets.

	This exercise can be done with any data set and is the bare bones skill you will need to type in markdown!
