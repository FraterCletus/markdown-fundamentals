![[PARA Method#Table]]

Here, we are going to focus on more on projects that require our attention on project planning. Don't worry about priorities immediately. Just consider this a location to brain dump ideas for projects you KNOW you need done.

# Brain Dump
 1. Fill in the table below. 
 2. Let the creativity flow through you. Maybe just worry about the tasks, rather than the other than fill out the rest of the table?
 3. Feel free to make this exercise your own. 
 4. The more information you can gather, the easier it is to complete the project.
 5. For this table/exercise, however, we are scratching the surface. 
 6. Name your project with `[[example project]]` brackets and when you are ready deep dive into your project, click the link and you will have a blank canvas to explore this.
 7. Use your templates folder 
	- Don't worry about priority immediately.
	- Take your time. If you don't know all the answers yet, the world will not fall apart.
