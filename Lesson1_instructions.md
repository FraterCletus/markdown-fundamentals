
## **Lesson Outline – Markdown & Obsidian Basics**

### Step 1. Practice Basic Text Manipulation

* Open **Simple Text Editing Practice**.
* Complete the tutorial exercises.
* Replace, remove, and reformat text using simple find/replace operations.
* Work until you are comfortable editing raw text efficiently.

### Step 2. Learn Markdown Fundamentals

* Open **Markdown Cheat Sheet**.
* Study each syntax rule (headings, bold, italics, lists, links, images, code blocks).
* Apply these in a new text document to reinforce learning.

### Step 3. Explore the Obsidian User Interface

* Open **Obsidian User Guide**.
* Create a new vault and a few test notes.
* Practice linking notes with `[[double brackets]]`.
* Find any broken links marked "User interface/". Fix them so that they link to an active file.

### Step 4. Convert Plain Text into a Markdown Vault

* Open one of your text manipulation practice files.
* Add Markdown formatting to structure it (headings, bullet points, links).
* Save the document in your Obsidian vault.
* Observe how Markdown formatting becomes interactive in Obsidian.

### Step 5. Visualize Connections with Graph View

* Open **Graph View** in Obsidian.
* Explore how linked notes appear as a network.
* Create a few intentional links to see how the structure grows.

### Step 6. Experiment with Canvas

* Open **Canvas** in Obsidian.
* Create a visual map of your Markdown lessons or ideas.
* Connect related notes or concepts visually.

### Step 7. Apply the PARA Method for Organization

* Open **PARA Method**.
* Classify your notes into four areas: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives.
* Tag and link your notes according to their purpose.
* Review your structure and adjust for clarity and ease of navigation.
